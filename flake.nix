  # Concat on Nix, Linux only: the people asking for a flake run Linux, and
  # the macOS and Windows builds ship from release.yml.
  #
  #   nix build            the editor window, ./result/bin/concat
  #   nix run              build and launch it
  #   nix develop          a shell with everything `cargo run -p concat` needs
  #
  # The build is one Cargo workspace under src/, so cargo dependencies
  # come straight from src/Cargo.lock and there is no vendor hash to keep
  # in sync. Three native pieces need care inside the sandbox, which has no
  # network:
  #
  # - FFmpeg is linked, not spawned. nixpkgs' ffmpeg_8 provides the headers
  #   and libraries; bindgen finds them through pkg-config and bindgenHook's
  #   libclang.
  # - whisper.cpp is compiled in by cmake from the source vendored inside
  #   whisper-rs-sys, so it needs cmake and a C++ toolchain and nothing else.
  # - sherpa-onnx (text to speech) links prebuilt static libraries that its
  #   sys crate would download at build time. They are fetched here as fixed-
  #   output derivations instead and handed over with SHERPA_ONNX_ARCHIVE_DIR.
  # - ONNX Runtime (the cutout models) is likewise downloaded by its sys
  #   crate. nixpkgs' onnxruntime is linked instead, through ORT_LIB_LOCATION,
  #   dynamically, so the wrapper's rpath finds it.
  # - Skia, the window's renderer as on every other platform, links prebuilt
  #   binaries that skia-bindings would download at build time. They are
  #   fetched here too and handed over as a file:// SKIA_BINARIES_URL; with
  #   a stale key or version the build falls back to compiling Skia from
  #   source, which the sandbox cannot do, so a mismatch fails loudly.
  #
  # Vulkan is loaded at run time, hence the LD_LIBRARY_PATH on the wrapper.
