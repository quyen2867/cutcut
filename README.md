## About

Concat is a free, open-source video editor and a CapCut alternative for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android. It covers what people actually open CapCut for: auto-captions, text-to-speech, background removal, keyframe animation, effects and titles, multi-track cutting, 4K export. With none of the catches: no watermark, no account, no subscription, no upload.

Everything runs locally on a native Rust engine with a GPU compositor. Install it, drop in footage, cut. The AI models for captions, voices and cutout download once from Settings and work offline after that. Your footage never leaves your disk.

**Good for:** TikTok, Reels and Shorts, YouTube videos, tutorials and screen recordings, podcast clips, memes.

**Also for machines:** a JSON-RPC, gRPC and MCP API, so scripts and AI agents can cut video with it too.

## Highlights

- 🚫 **No watermarks. No account. No paywall.** Ever.
- 🔒 **100% local.** Nothing uploads. Works offline.
- 💬 **Auto-captions.** Local Whisper. Pick a model size, get styled captions on the timeline.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-speech + voice cloning.** Free local voices, or any voice from a few seconds of a recording.
- 🧍 **Background removal.** People, objects, or paint the mask yourself.
- 🎞️ **Keyframes.** Position, scale, rotation, opacity, volume, effect parameters. Curve editor built in.
- ✨ **170+ effects, filters, transitions and text animations.** GPU-rendered, live in the preview.
- ✂️ **Cut fast.** Split, trim, ripple, merge, freeze frame, speed. Magnetic timeline if you want it.
- 🎚️ **Multi-track, multi-timeline.** Several cuts in one project. Blend modes, crop, flips.
- 📝 **Titles.** Fonts, stroke, shadow, background plate. Presets to start from.
- 🎙️ **One-switch voice cleanup.** Denoise, enhance voice, level the loudness. Plus chipmunk, robot, telephone and friends.
- 📤 **Export.** H.264, HEVC, AV1. Up to 4K 60, 10-bit colour.
- 🦀 **Native Rust engine.** GPU compositor, proxies, hardware decode. 4K scrubs smoothly.
- 🤖 **Scriptable.** JSON-RPC, gRPC and MCP API, plus a CLI. AI agents can cut video with it.
- 🖥️ **macOS, Windows, Linux, Android.** 14 languages. Same app, same project files.

## Download

Two ways in:

1. **[The website](https://concatenate.pages.dev/#download)** hands you the right build for your machine. Start here.
2. **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/quyen2867/cutcut/releases)** has every build for every platform, with installers, packages and checksums. For when you want to pick.

Concat is in **beta**: it works, and it still has edges. [Say so](https://github.com/quyen2867/cutcut/issues) when you find one.

**Platforms**

- ✅ **Windows** · x86_64
- ✅ **macOS** · Intel and Apple silicon. The binaries are unsigned, so if macOS refuses to open it: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Concat.app`
- ✅ **Linux** · x86_64 and ARM. `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and an Arch package
- ✅ **Android** · phones and tablets
- 🧪 **iOS / iPadOS** · iPhone and iPad, sideloaded

✅ Supported · 🚧 Work in progress · 🧪 To be tested

**System requirements**

Concat runs everything on your machine, so the hardware sets the ceiling. Minimum is what a build runs on at all; recommended is what makes 1080p editing feel smooth and keeps 4K exports and captions from being a wait.

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | Any 64-bit processor from 2013 or later | 6 cores or more |
| **GPU** | None. Without a usable GPU the window and monitor fall back to the CPU | Any GPU with Metal (macOS), DirectX 12 (Windows) or Vulkan (Linux) |
| **RAM** | **4 GB** | **16 GB** for 4K timelines and the larger caption models |
| **Storage** | **500 MB** for the app and the smallest caption model | **2 GB** for every optional model, plus room for projects and exports |

Optional models download from Settings on first use and then never need the network again: auto-captions 78 MB to 488 MB depending on the whisper size you pick, text-to-speech 132 MB or 349 MB, person cutout 15 MB, object cutout 179 MB, and the cutout brush 40 MB.

## Get started

Download it, open it, drop footage in, cut. No account, no setup.

**Reporting something:** every run writes a log, and Settings › About has the button that opens it along with the one that copies your system information. Attach both to an [issue](https://github.com/quyen2867/cutcut/issues) and the report arrives with everything it needs. The last ten runs are kept, so yesterday's is still there; nothing is ever sent anywhere on its own.

## How to Contribute

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The best way to contribute is to grab a build from the [Releases](https://github.com/quyen2867/cutcut/releases) page and use it: find where it breaks, and say where it could be better.
>
> Ready to write code? [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) covers setup, the layout of the tree, the checks to run, and how contributions are licensed. Driving Concat from a script, a service or an agent? [docs/](./docs/README.md) is the developer reference for the Concat API and its transports: JSON-RPC, gRPC and MCP. [This Discussion](https://github.com/quyen2867/cutcut/discussions/3) is where the project was announced.
