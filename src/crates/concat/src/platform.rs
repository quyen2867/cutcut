//! What the window asks of the platform it runs on.
//!
//! Four things differ between a desk and a phone: how the backend is
//! chosen, how a file or folder is picked, whether the window has a title
//! strip of its own to drag, and whether a file dragged in from outside the
//! window is even a thing that can happen. Everything else in the crate is
//! the same tree, the same state and the same callbacks, so the differences
//! live here and nowhere else.
//!
//! Desktop and iOS draw through the winit backend; Android through Slint's
//! android-activity backend, which the activity sets up before [`crate::run`]
//! is called. File dialogs are the desktop's: on a phone a pick goes through
//! the system's document picker, which arrives with the phone layout. A drag
//! in from the OS is a desktop thing for the same reason: winit only reports
//! `DroppedFile` on macOS, Windows and X11 - not Wayland, which has no such
//! event as of this winit, and not iOS, which has no such gesture.
