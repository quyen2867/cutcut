//! The one GPU device the window and the engine share.

//! Slint renders the window on it, and the monitor composites on it. Because
//! both sides hold the same device, a composited frame is a texture the
//! renderer samples directly: nothing is read back and nothing is copied.
//! Created before the backend is selected, because Slint takes the device at
//! selection time; `None` when the machine offers no adapter, and then the
//! window renders the way it did without one.
//!
//! On Android the backend owns its device and none is shared, so the type
//! is carried and never opened there; see platform.rs.
