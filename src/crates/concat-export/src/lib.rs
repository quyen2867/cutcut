//! Rendering a timeline to a file.
//!
//! This is the seam where a flattened clip list becomes the engine's
//! `concat_core::Timeline`, and from there the engine decides everything -
//! what is on screen (`concat-render`), what the sound means
//! (`concat_media::audio`), and how bytes move (`concat-media`). Transition
//! semantics resolve here too: by the time the picture and sound paths read
//! the clip list, transitions have already become overlaps, opacity ramps and
//! fade filters.
//!
//! It lives in the engine so the CLI, the host and the window render one
//! way, and so the doctrine holds: the host adds a destination and reports
//! progress, nothing more.
//!
//! Picture is composited frame by frame - on the GPU when the `gpu` feature
//! is on and the machine has one, with the CPU compositor as the
//! always-correct fallback. Sound is planned by the engine as one FFmpeg
//! filtergraph and mixed in a single pass.
