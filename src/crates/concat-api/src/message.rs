//! What crosses the API boundary: a [`Request`] in, a [`Response`] out,
//! and [`Event`]s along the way.
//!
//! All three are serde types with a fixed JSON shape, and that shape is the
//! contract: a transport is free to carry it over stdin, a socket or a
//! function call, but never to reinterpret it. Requests are tagged by
//! `method`, events by `event`, and a response is `{"result": ...}` or
//! `{"error": {"code": ..., "message": ...}}`. Fields are camelCase,
//! matching the document and the command layer, so a caller learns one
//! spelling. On a line or a socket the three travel inside the JSON-RPC 2.0
//! envelope [`crate::rpc`] describes, which adds an id to tie a response to
//! its request and nothing else.
//!
//! A method that takes longer than a caller should wait - an export - is a
//! job: the response names it at once, and everything that happens to it
//! comes back as [`Event`]s carrying that name, ending in `export.done` or
//! `export.failed`. A refusal is an [`ApiError`]: a [`ErrorCode`] a program
//! can branch on and the sentence a person would be shown.
//!
//! The edit vocabulary is not redefined here. [`Request::EditApply`] carries
//! a `concat_project` [`Command`] as it is, so every operation the window
//! can perform is one an API caller can perform, with the same clamps and
//! the same refusals, and a new command needs nothing added here.
