//! Where a downloadable model is fetched from, and what proves it arrived
//! whole.
//!
//! Concat carries no weights in its bundle: a cutout network, a Kokoro voice
//! bank and a whisper model together outweigh the editor many times over,
//! and most people never ask for all three. Each is fetched the first time a
//! feature needs one.
//!
//! Every model Concat offers is mirrored onto a release of its own
//! repository, and the mirror is what a download asks for first. Upstream -
//! the third party the mirror was filled from - is the second try and
//! nothing more: a model the editor offers should not stop existing because
//! somebody else moved a path, and the bytes that arrive should be the bytes
//! that were tested.
//!
//! The table of what is mirrored is `models/manifest.toml` at the root of
//! the repository, and `scripts/models.py --check` is what keeps it and the
//! engine's own tables saying the same thing. Every row carries the SHA-256
//! of its bytes, and a download is refused without one to check against;
//! Hugging Face upstreams are pinned to a commit, since `main` moves. The tables are here rather
//! than parsed from that file because a model's identity is something the
//! engine should not be able to start without.
