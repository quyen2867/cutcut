//! Pulling RGBA frames out of a file.
//!
//! One decoder does everything: it seeks to a start point and discards up to it frame-accurately,
//! turns the picture the way its rotation asks, scales, runs the clip's
//! effect chain through libavfilter, paces frames to a requested output rate
//! by duplicating and dropping, repeats a still forever, and stops after a
//! frame budget. Every frame comes with its real presentation timestamp.
//!
//! The codec runs on the platform's video hardware when the reader's
//! [`HwPolicy`] and the process-wide preference say so, and on the CPU
//! otherwise; see [`crate::hardware`]. A frame decoded on the device is
//! copied back before the filtergraph sees it, so everything from there on
//! is the same path, and a device that fails at any point hands the reader
//! to software from the frame it was at. The frames that come out are the
//! same either way, in count, size and timing; only the pixels may differ
//! by the rounding of a different colour conversion.
//!
//! ## On the unsafe in here
//!
//! The wrapper crate owns every pointer, and the one raw write here is the
//! threading setting the wrapper has no accessor for. What this module
//! owns is the order things happen in.
