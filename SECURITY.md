# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Concat is pre-1.0. Fixes go into the current minor release only; older
releases are not patched.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.2   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Report it privately through GitHub's advisory form:
https://github.com/quyen2867/cutcut/security/advisories/new

Include the version (Settings › About), the platform, and steps to
reproduce. A proof of concept helps; a project file that triggers the
problem helps most.

What to expect:

- An acknowledgement within 3 days.
- An update at least once a week while the report is open.
- If the report is accepted: a fix in the next release, a published
  advisory, and credit to you unless you would rather not be named.
- If it is declined: an explanation of why.

## What counts

Concat runs entirely on your machine. Reports we care about most:

- A project file, media file, template or effect package that causes
  code execution, writes outside the project folder, or reads files it
  was not given.
- A downloaded model or its mirror being swapped for something else
  without the digest check catching it.
- The API server (`concat-cli serve`, or Settings › Remote) accepting a
  call it should have refused: a missing or wrong token, on any address,
  or a server that started with no token at all.

By design, and not a vulnerability: the API server does whatever the
person who started it can do on that machine, and it is not encrypted.
Every connection presents a token, minted when none was set; binding to
anything other than 127.0.0.1 should sit behind something that provides
transport security.
